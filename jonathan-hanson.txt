Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline: displays an element as an inline element. Height and width properties will have no effect.
    block: will display element as a whole block. It starts on  a new line and will take up 100% of the width.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    The element position value is absolute or fixed.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?



    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    <button>: inline-block by default.
    <div>, <h1>, <header>: block by default.
    <span> <a>: inline



    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    The box model in CSS consist of the content in the middle of the box, then the padding, border, and margin parts of the box. The model allows us to add spacing and borders around elements.

    According to pressupinc.com the model has its limitiations (it is not responsive, etc.) and that the fix for this is box:sizing:border box
